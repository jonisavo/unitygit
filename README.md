UnityGit, at the time of writing, offers
- a window for creating commits, where the user can also view, diff and restore files
- a branch window for viewing branches, pulling and pushing.

UnityGit recognizes the Git repository inside the project's root folder and any repository
inside Packages.

UnityGit is powered by

- [LibGit2Sharp](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2sharp)
- [libgit2](http://libgit2.github.com/)
- [UIComponents](https://github.com/jonisavo/uicomponents).
