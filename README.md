UnityGit, at the time of writing, offers a commit window where users can commit changes made
to their project or packages. It also features diffing (via the diff tool configured in Unity)
and restoring capabilities.

UnityGit recognizes the Git repository inside the project's root folder and any repository
inside Packages.

UnityGit is powered by
